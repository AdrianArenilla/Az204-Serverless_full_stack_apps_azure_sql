## Microsoft AZ-204 - Build serverless, full stack applications in Azure

In this exercise, we will learn how to create, compile, and deploy modern full-stack applications in Azure with the language of your choice (Python, Node.js, or .NET) and with a Vue.js interface. Topics covered include modern database, CI / CD, and DevOps capabilities, backend API development, REST, and more. Using a real-world scenario of trying to take the bus, you will learn how to create a solution that uses Azure SQL Database, Azure Functions, Azure Static Web Apps, Logic Apps, Visual Studio Code, and GitHub Actions.
